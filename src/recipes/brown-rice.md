# Perfect Brown Rice Without a Rice Cooker

## Summary:

- One cup of brown rice
- 11 ounces of water
- 35 minutes
- 2–3 servings

## Procedure

1. Rinse the rice two or three times in cold water in a saucepan. Drain off the water.
2. Boil 11 ounces of water per cup of rice in an electric kettle.
3. Pour the water over the rice, cover, and bring to a boil on the stove.
4. If you want yellow rice, add a pinch of turmeric now. A little goes a long way.
5. Reduce to a simmer and cook, covered, for 35 minutes.

## Notes

This recipe works for short grain, long grain, and basmati rice.

Pro tip: if you forget to set a timer at first, watch for when the water is level with the rice.
Then it has 19 minutes left.
