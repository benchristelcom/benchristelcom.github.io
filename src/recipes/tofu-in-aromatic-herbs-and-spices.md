Adapted from _Classic Indian Cooking_ by Julie Sahni.

4-6 servings.

## Ingredients

- 2 containers of firm tofu
- 1/2 lemon
- 1/2 tsp Kosher salt (15-30 min) 
- 5 tbsp vegetable oil 
- 2 cups chopped onions 
- 1-2 Tbsp finely chopped garlic 
- 1-2 Tbsp chopped fresh ginger. 
- 1 stick cinnamon 
- 4 black or 8 green cardamom pods (you could substitute 1/2 tsp ground
  cardamom if you don't want to risk biting into the somewhat strong tasting
  pods).
- 6 whole cloves
- 1 Tbsp ground cumin
- 2 tsp ground coriander
- 1 tsp ground turmeric 
- 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper 
- 1 cup chopped or pureed ripe tomatoes (or one 15 oz. can) 
  - 1/3 cup almond or peanut butter
- four cups total:
  - frozen peas
  - sweet potatoes, carrots, and/or green beans, diced and steamed til tender.
- 1/2 c. slivered blanched almonds, toasted in a tsp of butter or oil
- 1/4 cup chopped fresh coriander (cilantro) for garnish

## Procedure

1. Cut tofu into slabs, drain on towels 20 minutes
1. Trim ends of green beans (if using), cut into one-inch pieces, and steam
   until tender.
1. Slice carrots and steam until tender.
1. Marinate tofu in juice of 1/2 lemon and 1/2 tsp Kosher salt, 15–30 min
1. In a heavy pan, heat 5 tbsp vegetable oil. Add 2 cups chopped onions and fry
   over medium-high heat for 15–20 min, until light brown, stirring constantly.
1. Add 1–2 Tbsp finely chopped garlic and 1–2 Tbsp chopped fresh ginger. Cook 2
   minutes.
1. Add 1 stick cinnamon, 4 black or 8 green cardamom pods, and 6 whole cloves.
   Cook until cardamom is puffed and beginning to brown — 2 minutes.
1. Add marinated tofu pieces and spices (1 Tbsp ground cumin, 2 tsp ground
   coriander, 1 tsp ground tumeric, 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper). Stir gently to
   coat the tofu.
1. Add and stir in 1 cup chopped or pureed ripe tomatoes (or one 15 oz. can),
   1/3 cup almond butter, and hot water to barely cover the tofu. Bring
   to a boil and reduce heat to a simmer. Cook covered for 20 min, stirring
   often — add more water if needed to prevent sticking.
1. Add optional veggies (frozen peas and or diced steamed carrots) during last
   few minutes of simmer time. 
1. Turn off heat and let rest about one hour. The flavors improve if this is
   left in the fridge overnight!
1. Reheat to serve, and garnish with cilantro and slivered almonds that you
   have toasted in a tsp of butter or oil. Serve over [rice].
