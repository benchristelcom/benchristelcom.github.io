## The day before

Soak the kidney beans.

## Procedure

### Thread 1: Stew

- Bring the beans to a boil and simmer, covered, about 90 minutes. Add a teaspoon of salt when the beans start to get tender. When they are fully cooked, drain off any excess liquid, until the water just covers the beans.
- Puncture the dried limes a few times with a sturdy fork, and add them to the beans. Continue to simmer.

### Thread 2: Herbs

- Remove the largest stems from the fresh herbs (parsley and cilantro).Wash and dry them. Set them out for a few hours to completely dry before chopping them.
- Chop the herbs very finely in a food processor.
- Sauté the minced scallions in 1/4 cup olive oil. After a couple minutes, add the chopped fresh herbs. Continue cooking the herbs, stirring frequently, until they are very dark green, almost dry, and exude a sweet-smelling green oil when squeezed—about 30 or 40 minutes.

### Thread 3: Sauté

- Dice the yellow onion and sauté in olive oil until browned. Add diced carrots (optional), quartered mushrooms, a sprinkle of salt and black pepper, and a heaping teaspoon of turmeric.
- Add the onion/mushroom mixture to the stew.

### Thread#join

- Add the cooked herbs and a tablespoon of dried fenugreek to the stew.
- Add the chopped spinach (if using). You can stir-fry it a bit first to deglaze the pan.
- Check the consistency of the stew. It should not be runny. If it is too watery, let it simmer uncovered.
- Simmer at least half an hour.

Serve over rice, with yogurt on the side.
