# Ma Po (Mapo) Tofu

https://www.travelchinaguide.com/tour/food/chinese-cooking/mapo-tofu.htm

## Ingredients

Quantities can be eyeballed, but I do approximately:

For each pound of tofu:

- 1.5 Tbsp garlic
- 1.5 Tbsp ginger
- 1 bunch of green onions (about 5–6)
- 1 Tbsp black bean paste
- dried chilies and hot oil to taste
- 1 tsp Szechuan pepper
- as much Beyond Meat as you have around (I often make this recipe to use up
  leftover "meat" after making [chili]).
