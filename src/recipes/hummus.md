# Hummus

## Hardware

- Food processor

## Ingredients

- 1 lb dry garbanzo beans
- 1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil
- 3 Tbsp tahini
- juice of 1 lemon
- 1 1/2 tsp salt

## Procedure

### Day 1

1. Soak the garbanzo beans overnight

### Day 2

1. Drain the beans and bring to a boil in fresh water.
2. Simmer 60-90 minutes, until tender. Optionally, add salt when the beans start to softenâ€”this can speed up the cooking.
3. Drain the beans and let them cool before making hummus.

## Variant: Hummus in a Hurry

Almost as good and much quicker: put about half a cup of drained cooked or
canned garbanzos in a flat-bottomed container. Mash with a fork. Sprinkle with
salt and add about a tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil. Mash more to combine
ingredients. Consume immediately.
