## Procedure

### Thread 1: Lentils

1. Sauté the onion in oil until it begins to brown.
1. Add carrots, chard stems, and jalapeño. Cook 5-10 minutes.
1. Add ground spices. Cook 2 minutes.
1. Add tomatoes and salt. Cook 5-10 minutes.

Add more water as necessary to keep everything covered.
Be careful not to overcook the lentils. They should take about 20 minutes.

### Thread 2: Tempering

1. Add:
   - 2 1/2 tsp whole cumin seeds

   - 5 dried red peppers, crushed
1. Wait for the butter to bubble and then cook for 2 minutes.

When the tempering is done, add it to the lentils so the flavors have time to blend. Add crushed dried fenugreek leaves a few minutes before removing from heat.

## Notes

You can substitute yellow split peas for lentils, but you'll have to observe the following changes:

- rinse the split peas thoroughly until they stop producing foam.
- cook them separately (45–60 minutes) and add them to the tomatoes and onions at the point where you'd add raw lentils.
