## Ingredients

### Stir-fry

- 2 Tbsp vegetable oil (plus 4 Tbsp for the sauce; see below)
- 3 shallots, diced
- 3 green onions / scallions, diced
- 2 tsp fresh ginger, minced
- 1 large carrot, sliced
- 1 small Savoy cabbage, cut into approx. 1 inch squares
- 2 packages firm tofu, cut into bite-sized rectangles
- 1/4 cup black peppercorns, crushed with a mortar and pestle.
- 1 Tbsp cornstarch

### Sauce

- 6 Tbsp low-sodium soy sauce
- 3 Tbsp oyster sauce
- 3 Tbsp mirin (sweetened rice wine)
- 4 Tbsp vegetable oil

## Procedure

1. Mix the sauce ingredients together and set aside.
2. Place the tofu pieces on two baking trays. Bake at 220Â°F until lightly
   browned.
3. Heat 2 Tbsp oil in a large pot or Dutch oven.
4. Stir-fry the vegetables in the order listed.
5. Give the sauce one final stir to make sure the oil is mixed in. Add the
   sauce, tofu, and pepper to the stir-fry. Add water to almost cover
   the veggies (you want this dish to have a stew-like consistency).
6. Simmer 10 minutes.
7. Mix the cornstarch with some cold water, and then mix that into the sauce to
   thicken it.
