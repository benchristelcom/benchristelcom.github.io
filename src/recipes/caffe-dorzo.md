# Caffè d'Orzo

An Italian-style caffeine-free coffee substitute, made from barley.

## Ingredients

- whole barley

## Procedure

1. Spread barley on a baking tray and bake at 400ºF for 20 minutes, stirring once
   or twice during that time.
2. In a coffee grinder, grind the barley as fine as you can.
3. Brew in a French press or moka pot.

## Notes

400ºF makes a very dark roast. 350º is too light, though. I'd do 375º next time.
