# Caffè d'Orzo

An Italian-style caffeine-free coffee substitute, made from barley.

## Ingredients

- whole barley

## Procedure

1. Spread barley on a baking tray and bake at 400ºF for 20 minutes, stirring once
   or twice during that time.
2. In a coffee grinder, grind the barley as fine as you can.
3. Brew in a French press or moka pot.

## Notes

400ºF makes a very dark roast. 350º is too light, though. I'd do 375º next time.

The roasting process will make your whole house smell like burnt coffee if you
do it indoors. You won't notice, if you're in the room while it is taking
place, but other people will. Running an exhaust fan doesn't really help. Maybe
move your toaster oven outdoors.
