# Castles of Annuvin

A 6-player map that removes the tedious parts of the game and presents many
PvP and PvE opportunities!

## Special features

- No taverns after you hire your two starting heroes. Additional heroes can be
  obtained from prisons.
- Creature dwellings revert to the red (Might) player every turn, removing the
  need for caravan micro. Red's starting towns can't build caravans.

## Victory condition

- Capture 3 of the 6 castle towns on the map (6 of the 12 towns start with
  Castles, 6 have the Castle disabled)

## Loss condition

- Lose all towns and armies
