# Scenario Notes

This page contains my notes on the scenario maps that come with Heroes IV and its expansions.

I'm taking these notes in order to figure out what I like about the game and maybe learn something about map design.

Very straightforward map, suitable for introducing beginners to the game.
Not very much fun, though. Each player has a town and access to a mine of each type. The players are separated by a wall with a few guarded garrisons in it. There are also two ways to get around the wall, similarly guarded. Your starting hero is level 5. Other than that, everything is bog-standard.

There are no really challenging fights on the map (I only saw one rank 3 monster and no rank 4s) and very few interesting decisions to make.
