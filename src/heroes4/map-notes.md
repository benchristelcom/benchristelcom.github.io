# Scenario Notes

This page contains my notes on the scenario maps that come with Heroes IV and its expansions.

I'm taking these notes in order to figure out what I like about the game and maybe learn something about map design.

### Play 1

| Setting            | Value        |
| ------------------ | ------------ |
| Stationary guards  | Yes          |
| Difficulty         | Intermediate |
| Human player color | Red          |
| Alignment          | Might        |

Very straightforward map, suitable for introducing beginners to the game.
Not very much fun, though. Each player has a town and access to a mine of each type. The players are separated by a wall with a few guarded garrisons in it. There are also two ways to get around the wall, similarly guarded. Your starting hero is level 5. Other than that, everything is bog-standard.

There are no really challenging fights on the map (I only saw one rank 3 monster and no rank 4s) and very few interesting decisions to make.

You play against two computer players who are not allied. You have to get to them and conquer their towns before they can get to yours. You have several advantages: access to extra creatures, items, and powerups, and a back door to get into their base, which they are blocked from using.

You start with all buildings and two mid-level heroes (levels 10 and 15). I liked the accelerated start — it provides more tactical options — but the fights didn't seem to have been made more difficult to match. The only slightly difficult fights are the rank-4 "bosses" you have to get past to reach your opponent, and fortunately for me, the AI player took care of those right at the moment I wanted to attack.

I'd recommend this map as a way to introduce new players to the midgame.
