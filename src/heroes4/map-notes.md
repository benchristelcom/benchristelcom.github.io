# Scenario Notes

This page contains my notes on the scenario maps that come with Heroes IV and its expansions.

I'm taking these notes in order to figure out what I like about the game and maybe learn something about map design.

## A Tale of Two Enemies

| Difficulty         | Intermediate |

Very straightforward map, suitable for introducing beginners to the game.
Not very much fun, though. Each player has a town and access to a mine of each type. The players are separated by a wall with a few guarded garrisons in it. There are also two ways to get around the wall, similarly guarded. Your starting hero is level 5. Other than that, everything is bog-standard.

There are no really challenging fights on the map (I only saw one rank 3 monster and no rank 4s) and very few interesting decisions to make.

You play against two computer players who are not allied. You have to get to them and conquer their towns before they can get to yours. You have several advantages: access to extra creatures, items, and powerups, and a back door to get into their base, which they are blocked from using.

You start with all buildings and two mid-level heroes (levels 10 and 15). I liked the accelerated start — it provides more tactical options — but the fights didn't seem to have been made more difficult to match. The only slightly difficult fights are the rank-4 "bosses" you have to get past to reach your opponent, and fortunately for me, the AI player took care of those right at the moment I wanted to attack.

I'd recommend this map as a way to introduce new players to the midgame.

Pretty standard symmetric two-player map. There is one route to the other player, and the first one to traverse it gets a bunch of free items. My one complaint about this map is that the layout of each player's side is very linear with the town at one end, which results in a lot of running back and forth despite the small map size.

The scenario has a (_very_ thin) plot. At least they tried.

| Alignment          | Order        |

In this scenario, you set out to conquer the Jumbled Wood, which isn't really all that jumbled. There are several side quests, but who has time for that? I ignored the quests and just cruised around the map taking every town. Maybe if the AIs had defended themselves better I wouldn't have felt the urge to murder them all as quickly as possible.

The map is generous with gold (you get a mine pretty early) so Order might be easier than other alignments.

Overall, a memorable map, though I wish the quests had been more integral.

This map annoyed me. You're railroaded onto a linear path, so it takes a long time to get anywhere. The quests are simplistic. The writing is obnoxious. Your opponents are stationary targets. It has its moments, but it greatly overstays its welcome.

Interesting asymmetrical two-player map. Both players have Nature towns, but one is restricted to wolves, tigers, griffins, and faerie dragons, while the other is restricted to sprites, elves, unicorns, and phoenixes. There is a third, computer-only player, whose town cannot be captured by either human player. The game ends when either player's town is captured. There are several portals and looped paths between the towns, and a couple gold mines to fight over.

I can see this being a fun map if played against another human. Unfortunately, the computer players are too weak to make for a fun fight. I was able to hold both gold mines pretty consistently. I won because my opponent left their town empty, and I strode in with a single hero. Kind of anticlimactic.

Another downside is that there's a lot of micromanagement since each player is trying to kite the other. This would make turns take a long time in a human-vs-human game.

Might is probably the easiest alignment on this map, where you fight against Chaos and magic resistance is quite helpful. There are plenty of opportunities for hero progression, and I was able to get Grandmaster in all combat skills by the end of the game. A memorable map.

Fun two-player duel between life and death. You start with a level 17 hero and no town, and must race to a central cache of treasure and then defeat your opponent's hero. Unfortunately, the AI is terrible at this map. I don't know if it misjudges the fights (underestimating its hero) or what. The fights against neutral creatures are also quite easy, some bizarrely so — why did the mapmaker even bother putting them there? I would play on a higher difficulty setting next time. I imagine this would be fun to play against another human, but it might turn into a battle of who has the best adventure-map micro.

| Alignment          | Nature       |

You start with a single archer hero, and no access to taverns, and must conquer a series of towns to ultimately defeat the pirate "boss". The map suffers from too much adventure-map micro - lots of scouting enemy towns with a single unit to see if they're empty, caravanning units from creature dwellings, etc. I defeated the AI's main army halfway through the game, and they never recovered, so the boss fight ended up being anticlimactic. Being limited to a single hero made for an interesting game, though, since I could only threaten one town at a time, and had to use my main hero to take mines.

Proof that you can fit 6 towns on a small map. There are also portals everywhere so the map is indeed quite claustrophobic. You play as Death and must conquer 2 Life and 3 Nature towns. The map is generous with gold, but for some reason, none of the AIs got level 4 creatures.

Oddly, this map has an asymmetrical plot (a peasant revolt) but a symmetrical layout. Maybe there's a political message there? Probably not.

I'm not sure why the map self-describes as "expert level". The fights were quite easy, and the map is generous with gold and units. One interesting feature is that the passage to the other player's area can only be traversed if you have more than 15k gold, which delays the rush for fourth-level creatures.

This map gives you an ally who is more of a hindrance than a help. You have to rush to grab the gold mines and creature dwellings before they can. I won pretty quickly due to the AI's stupidity. I feel like the boss hero (a level 20 warlord) could have just walked across the map and taken my town if the AI had known what it was doing.

This map strained my trollstrat-fu to the limits. At one point I had to conquer a town by repeatedly attacking with a single Barbarian equipped with Potions of Immortality, retreating home each time his health got low. You start with only Beowulf and can't get more heroes. Your enemy (Chaos) can access your half of the map via one-way portals, so you have to play pretty defensively. The winning strategy seems to be to sit at home and guard your towns most of the time, which seems rather un-Beowulf-like.

A map with an actual plot! I might even have laughed at the humorous dialogue!

You have to get past a couple of opponent players to get to the boss. The first of these has a random alignment and can be eliminated; the second is always Chaos and can't be eliminated. The swamp, snow, and water covering most of the map make it seem larger than it is.

Symmetrical 3-player map. Each player can rescue a level 15 general from prison by defeating a few hundred skeletons. This puts Death at a slight disadvantage, since it's hard to keep vampires alive when fighting undead. As with many of these maps, I imagine this one might be fun to play against other humans, but vs. AI it was pretty boring.

Beautiful, naturalistic map. It felt like I was exploring a real place instead of an artificial game level. There are many locales with distinct personalities. It's interesting to see the differences in design style between this (medium-sized) map and some of the small maps. This map uses distance, not just guards or barriers, as an obstacle. Especially in the early game, the choice of whether to go in one direction or the other felt like an important one with opportunity costs. The map gives you a lot of free stuff, rewarding exploration. Gold is oddly scarce but other resources are abundant. I would have appreciated a few more towns on the map since it felt like progression stalled after the first month.

Several things about this map annoy me. The boss enemies are stationary targets. There's a time limit, and the map is literally a maze, so there's a lot of micromanagement and caravaning armies around. I didn't have quite enough time to explore the whole map, yet the endgame felt very slow and tedious because I was just building up armies and sending my heroes around to collect powerups. At least there's lots to explore, and the fights are fun.

Two teams of two — Death and Nature against Life and Order — face off across
Barbarian territory. There are a few weird things about this map. One is that
your second town shares your ally's alignment, which is awkward because the
allies have incompatible alignments. I delayed capturing my second town,
hoping that I could grab the Death town on the other side of the river and let
my ally have the Nature town, but it eventually became apparent that that was
infeasible. The other weird thing is that you can't get spells in your main
town past first level, making it even more important to visit the other town.
The barbarians didn't put up much of a fight, but there is a timed
event on their town that causes it to revert to the Might player a few days
after capture.
