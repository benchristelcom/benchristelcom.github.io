# How does the midgame fail to be fun?

Many Heroes IV maps have interesting openings but fall apart in the midgame.
The pace of the game slows and fights become boring. In this essay I explore
the possible causes of this problem and the potential cures.

## Too many towns

Many maps simply have too many towns. Long after victory has become inevitable,
you are still running around the map trying to kill the scattered AI armies and
hold all the towns.

One way to deal with this is simply to have fewer towns. You can also add a
custom victory script that ends the game earlier (e.g. once one player has
captured 4 towns, or reached some other goal other than total conquest).

## Caravan micro

The AI might steal creature dwellings from you at any time, so optimal play
involves manually caravaning creatures to your towns every turn. This is boring
and it's stupid that the game makes you spend time doing it.

Fixes include:

- eliminating creature dwellings from the map
- banning caravans (though that prevents players from getting Nomads or Nightmares in their towns)
- using a timed event to reset the owner of creature dwellings periodically
- using hostile garrisons or [border gates to block the path of caravans](quest-gate-caravans.md)

## Empty areas
## Fights all too easy or too hard
## Winning every fight the same way
## Items you can't use (hero full)
## Junk items

What the game seems to want you to do is grow forever: more towns, more heroes,
more dwellings, more mines, bigger armies.

What actually happens is that growth becomes both tedious and unnecessary.
