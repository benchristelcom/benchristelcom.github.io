# OnThatPath Video Summaries

YouTube user [@onthatpath](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKuHpb6N1jLet2ZzNXntNmA) has as series of videos about meditation. I have found them to be an _extremely_ helpful supplement to the book _The Mind Illuminated_ by Culadasa. Each video is short, but in total they are a couple hours, so I thought I'd summarize them here, both for my own reference and to help others.

I recommend watching all of the videos, and then referring to this page when you need a refresher to boost your meditation practice.

## [Why You Feel Stress and Dissatisfaction in Life (Part 1)](https://benchristel.github.io/yt/#i1izrpQqvP4)

Suffering, stress, baseline dissatisfaction, and anxiety can all be termed ***dukkha*** in Pali.

Dukkha has a cause, just like any other natural/physical process.

The causes of dukkha are **desire** (wanting more of something) and **aversion** (wanting less of something).

### How the creation of dukkha is experienced subjectively

The world you're experiencing right now is a "3D space" of **awareness**. It's not a thing, but a process [in your mind]. Awareness is always present, and it encompasses *everything* you see/hear/feel/think/know right now.

> As far as here and now is concerned, what isn't in awareness might as well not exist.
>
> —Culadasa

Starting from awareness, your mind goes through a series of causal steps to produce dukkha/suffering:

1. **Attention:** Your mind first starts _attention_, a process that selects objects out of awareness and analyzes them conceptually.
    Attention feels almost like an "arrow" or "flashlight" that emerges somewhere in your head and focuses on objects "out there" in reality.
2. **Sense of self:** Then, almost automatically, attention gives rise to subject/object duality. This is the feeling of being an observer inside your head. 
    Currently you probably take this feeling for granted and maybe even think it's just the way reality is. But this feeling of being a separate self is a mind-generated illusion!
3. **Concepts and feeling:** Once attention has focused on an object, conceptual analysis starts. The object gets a verbal label, and is associated with a "feeling tone" which ranges from pleasant, to neutral, to unpleasant. This "feeling tone" might be experienced somewhere in your chest.
4. **Craving:** This feeling tone, plus the sense of self from step 2, cause survival drives to kick in. If the feeling is pleasant, you crave more of it (desire), and if it's unpleasant, you want to run away from it or destroy it (aversion).
5. **Clinging:** If the craving isn't stopped within a few seconds, attention will start to "stick" to the object. It almost feels like the base of attention in your head is tightening up or being pulled toward the object.
6. **Reactive intention:** You start planning or even acting to get more of the thing you're craving (or get rid of it if the feeling is aversive). Whether the feeling is positive or negative, **reactive intention causes an increase in dukkha.** There is a short-term "halo" effect where reacting feels good, but once that wears off you are left with the dukkha that built up underneath.

The final link of the chain, _selfing_, is described in the next video.

### Why hedonism doesn't work

Most people's default philosophy is _hedonism._ I.e. they try to become happy by seeking what is pleasant, and avoiding what is unpleasant.

The problem is that even if you succeed in finding pleasure, it is short-lived, and then you are left with the dukkha that built up underneath.

(continued from the previous video)

7. **Mental state degradation / selfing:** The final link of the causal chain that creates dukkha is an increase in ego (the sense of being a separate self) and a degradation of your **mental state**.

### Mental state

Imagine we could rate your mental state from 0 to 100, where:

- 100 is perfect bliss and contentment
- 50 is an average, normal day
- 0 is suicidal depression

Example scenario: you start your day at state 50, but then someone criticizes you, and you **react.** This causes your mental state to degrade to 40. In a few minutes, the situation is over, but you still feel like your day is ruined for hours afterward.

Mental state degradation happens because of an increase in your sense of self. The more you feel like a separate self, the more anxious you will be, because you are constantly on the lookout for threats and resources ("me vs. the world" attitude).

### Feedback loop (poop-tinted glasses)

Mental state feeds back into the dukkha-creating process discussed earlier, specifically in the step where the feeling tone appears.

Higher mental state = more positive feelings about your experiences. Lower mental state = more negative feelings.

A.K.A. "rose-tinted glasses" vs. "poop-tinted glasses".

The result is that both positive and negative mental states are **self-reinforcing**.

### Attention is also conditioned

If you could control your attention, you could prevent craving and clinging and thereby prevent dukkha from arising!

Unfortunately, you can't control it directly. Attention depends on causes and conditions like everything else. If you've ever tried to "meditate by force" (keep your attention on something for many minutes at a time) you know how little control you really have over it.

[Note: the right way to meditate is _not_ to try to force attention to do something, but to calm the mind so attention settles down on its own! —B.C.]

The cause of attention is **intention** or **"doership"**.

### Intention

**Intention or Doership** includes verbal, bodily, and mental intentions (thinking, planning, logical analysis). I.e. anything that "you" do intentionally.

These intentions are not controlled by a single, central self or "you"!

Instead, a better model of how intentions arise is a parliamentary model. You have a bunch of "sub-minds" that vote on your intentions, like MPs in parliament. They are subconscious and outside your direct control.

Subjectively, intentions feel almost like a buildup of tension in some part of your mind/body awareness.

- Verbal intentions feel like a nucleus of tension in your jaw or tongue.
- Bodily intentions — legs or arms.
- Mental intentions — forehead.
- Intentions can also feel like restlessness.

### Unawareness / Ignorance

Why would the MPs in your subconscious mind vote for intentions that are just going to cause dukkha? Because they aren't aware of the consequences of their actions. They can't clearly see the process by which dukkha happens and don't really "believe" the process is real.

By destroying this deep, subconscious ignorance, you can permanently get free of suffering.

### Buddhist concepts

This video and the previous video cover the **second noble truth**.

The causal chain that creates dukkha is **dependent origination**.

- Intention / doership is usually translated **formations**
- Attention — **consciousness**
- Reaction — **becoming**
- Mental state degradation — **rebirth**

The game of going up and down mental states = **samsara**.

## [How to Permanently Be Free from Stress, Suffering, &amp; Dissatisfaction: The Prognosis &amp; Prescription](https://benchristel.github.io/yt#bMsTcqtWi1o)

Good news! It is possible to improve your [mental state](#mental-state), e.g. from level 50 (or lower) to 100.

However, even if you get to state 100, it's possible to fall back down.

The ultimate goal is to completely get out of the game of going up and down the mental states (***samsara***), by reaching ***nirvana***/***nibbana***/***moksha***.

The way to do that is by getting rid of the [ignorance](#unawareness--ignorance) which causes the [intentions](#intention) that start the dependent origination process.

Analogy: if you've burned your hand on a hot pan, you wouldn't intentionally touch it again, because you can clearly see the cause and effect. You don't even have to think about avoiding touching it; it's automatic. Similarly, you can train your mind to avoid dependent origination instinctively, by showing it the causal chain.

### The prescription

Your mind's natural inclination is to rise up like a hot air balloon to mental state 100, unless something is pulling it back down.

You don't have to *do* anything to be happy.

In fact, trying to be happy tends to cause craving/clinging/reaction, which is counterproductive.

All you have to do is stop the chain of dependent origination, by breaking the causal links, and your mental state will rise up **on its own**.

### Breaking the links

There are several places we can break the dependent origination chain.

- **Virtue** - counters reaction
- **Letting go** - counters craving and clinging
- **Wholesome or effortless intentions** - counters subject/object duality
- **Mindfulness** - counters unawareness/ignorance

### Buddhist Concepts

This video covers the third and fourth noble truth.

The techniques for breaking the dependent origination chain are parts of the eightfold path.

- **Virtue** is similar to **right action** and **right speech**
- **Letting go** is similar to **right effort**
- **Wholesome or effortless intentions** is similar to **right intention**
- **Mindfulness** is similar to **right mindfulness**

Letting your mind rise to state 100 in meditation is similar to **right samadhi**.
