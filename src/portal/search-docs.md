# Searching the Web Portal

This page documents the search bar on the [Web Portal page](/portal/).

## Check the box to autofocus the search bar

You can make the searchbar focus automatically when the page loads, so you don't have to click it before you type your query. Check the box under [Settings](/portal#settings).

## Type to filter

The first function of the searchbar is to filter the portal page. You've probably discovered this if you've ever typed anything into the search bar.

Filtering uses **"and"** logic: in order for an item to be shown in the search results, it must match _all_ the words in the search.

The matching is **case-insensitive**. Search terms are matched against the **beginnings of words** on the page, so if you search for `script`, you will find words like "scripts" and "scripting". However, a search for `script` will _not_ match a word like "JavaScript" â€” only words that _start_ with "script" will match.

If your search matches the text of a **heading** on the page, everything under that heading will be shown.

## Hint Enter for fast navigation

After typing your search, you can navigate directly to the first link shown on the page by pressing the `enter` key.

Exception: if your search includes an exclamation point `!`, pressing `enter` will search the web instead of navigating to a link. See the section below on [using DuckDuckGo bangs](#using-duckduckgo-bangs).

## Web search

You can also use the searchbar to search the web. Several search engines have dedicated buttons, and thousands more can be accessed via [DuckDuckGo bangs](#using-duckduckgo-bangs).

### Using DuckDuckGo bangs

If your favorite search engine isn't in the list, you can use a [DuckDuckGo bang](https://duckduckgo.com/bangs) to invoke it. For example, typing "fruit bat !g" and then pressing `enter` will search Google for the term "fruit bat."

## Shortcuts

I have hard-coded a few shortcuts into the searchbar for my own use. Typing a shortcut and pressing `enter` takes you directly to the corresponding URL.

| Shortcut | URL | Description |
| -------- | --- | ----------- |
| tv       | https://benchristel.github.io/tv/ | Culture Machine
| zen      | https://benchristel.github.io/meditation/ | Meditation timer
| bliki    | https://github.com/benchristel/benchristel.github.io/wiki | My digital garden
| yt       | https://benchristel.github.io/yt | YouTube prophylactic
| mail     | https://mail.google.com/ | GMail
