So far, we have not discussed any of the language features you'd likely encounter in a grammar textbook for a typical human language: plurals, verb tenses, pronouns, etc. Those features are not part of OGTRTA proper; they are left up to the individual language designer.

It can be somewhat tricky to figure out how to work some of these features into an OGTRTA language without disrupting the syntactic and lexical architecture that OGTRTA provides. This page aims to solve that problem with how-to guides and examples.

## General strategies

### Affixation

### Subordination

### Null morphemes

## Determiners

## Grammatical number

## Adjectives

## Prepositions

## Tenses

## Negation

## Pronouns

## Possessives

## Valence-changing

## Verb nominalization

## Imperatives as NPs

## Questions as NPs

## Relative clauses

## Trace pronouns

## Demonstratives

## Numbers

## Inchoative and cessative

Prepositions "to" and "from", and variants like "onto" and "from out of" can be replaced by inchoative and cessastive inflections of other prepositions. E.g. "to" can be `at1#INCH`. "for" (dative) can be `of1#INCH`.
