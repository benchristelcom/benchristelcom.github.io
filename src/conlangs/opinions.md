# Strong Opinions (Loosely Held) About Conlangs

## I don't really care about fictional languages

Some people invent languages for fictional people to speak. I don't get this. I mean, you do whatever you want, but like... fictional people don't exist. Maybe this is just an extension of my lack of caring about fiction generally.

(_The Lord of the Rings_ is not fiction, btw. It's mythology.)

## I don't really care about IALs

English is already the _de facto_ IAL. No Esperanto clone will ever get close. This situation sucks, because English has been parasitized by cancerous, planet-destroying ideologies, and every place it spreads to slowly dies. But IALs are not going to fix the situation.

## I _do_ care about artlangs

Conlangs can be beautiful, so they should be. They can be cool and interesting, so they should be. They're a lot of work to make, so why would you aim for anything less than this?

## I _do_ care about engelangs

Creating a conlang grammar is a fun engineering project. Figuring out how to make all of the different systems in a language work elegantly and expressively together is challenging and rewarding. I hope I haven't ruined the fun too much by inventing [OGTRTA](ogtrta), which is already very nearly ideal in every way and will continue to improve over time.

## Conlangs should be learnable

If even the creator of the language has no hope of ever being able to speak or write it fluently, what's even the point?

## Agreement causes more problems than it solves

## Numberless should be the default
