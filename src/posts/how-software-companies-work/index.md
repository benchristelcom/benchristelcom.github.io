# How Software Companies Work (Or Don't)

https://deming.org/nobody-gives-a-hoot-about-profit/

Priorities:

- Individual well-being
- Profit
- Making a useful product

These are connected. But what the priority ranking means is that if profit can
be sacrificed for an employee's or executive's individual well-being, it will
be. And if product quality can be sacrified for profit, it will be. Opportunities
for such sacrifices occur more frequently than an outsider to the technosphere
might imagine.

> Imagine a company with a rigorous “business case” ritual required before any work begins. It forces premature convergence on solutions, encourages inflated estimates, and produces a dozen teams all claiming credit for the same metric (which is impossible to move by 3,000 percent). The work cuts across 15 teams, triggering massive context switching and draining capacity from more focused initiatives. On paper, the company has followed every rule in its combined self-imposed and externally imposed governance framework. In reality, it has done a disservice to investors, employees, customers, and taxpayers because the process is defensible on the surface but fails any reasonable principled analysis.

> The difference is often referred to as the gap between procedural legitimacy and substantive legitimacy. Procedural legitimacy is performative box-ticking. Substantive legitimacy is the degree to which actions genuinely advance the intended policy goals.

> I meet a lot of product builders and makers who have a deep discomfort with how their companies govern technology investments. They cannot always articulate it, but they sense they are participating in an exercise in procedural legitimacy that is hurting customers, team members, and investors. “If only investors understood what is happening here, they would flee en masse,” a VP of Product told me recently. The waste is off the charts, yet on paper, everything is being done by the book.
>
> That is procedural vs. structural legitimacy.

> What you are feeling is real.

> Tech giants went on hiring sprees earlier in the pandemic in pursuit of what Keith Rabois, a Silicon Valley investor, called the "vanity metric" of head count, where employers expand their workforce to stand out among their rivals.

Meanwhile, Sergey Brin urges employees to work 60-hour weeks chasing the pipe dream of AGI.

Both extremes are failures of management. Paying people to be ineffective is bad.
Equating hours worked with value is also bad. But both behaviors can be explained
by the prioritization of individual well-being (which includes pay and reputation)
over quality and corporate profits.

Two months after Sergey Brin mandated long hours for the sake of AGI, it was
revealed that Google was paying some top AI experts to do... nothing.

Can this juxtaposition of events be reconciled with the idea that companies
maximize profit? I challenge the reader to try. It will require a more
elaborately contorted apologia than I am capable of.
