# How Software Companies Work (Or Don't)

> Imagine a company with a rigorous “business case” ritual required before any work begins. It forces premature convergence on solutions, encourages inflated estimates, and produces a dozen teams all claiming credit for the same metric (which is impossible to move by 3,000 percent). The work cuts across 15 teams, triggering massive context switching and draining capacity from more focused initiatives. On paper, the company has followed every rule in its combined self-imposed and externally imposed governance framework. In reality, it has done a disservice to investors, employees, customers, and taxpayers because the process is defensible on the surface but fails any reasonable principled analysis.

> I meet a lot of product builders and makers who have a deep discomfort with how their companies govern technology investments. They cannot always articulate it, but they sense they are participating in an exercise in procedural legitimacy that is hurting customers, team members, and investors. “If only investors understood what is happening here, they would flee en masse,” a VP of Product told me recently. The waste is off the charts, yet on paper, everything is being done by the book.

> That is procedural vs. structural legitimacy.
