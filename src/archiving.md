# Web Archives and Archiving Tools

## Archives

- [archive.org](https://archive.org) - Probably needs no introduction. The "Wayback Machine" has snapshots of websites going back 3 decades.
- [Ghost Archive](https://ghostarchive.org/) - Another archive. Currently, their collection is kind of sparse.

## Archiving Tools

- [wayback-machine-downloader](https://github.com/ShiftaDeband/wayback-machine-downloader) - Archives websites from the Wayback Machine ([web.archive.org](https://web.archive.org)). Has some bugs and performance issues. I'm working on fixing those.
