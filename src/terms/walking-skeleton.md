# Walking Skeleton

A **walking skeleton** is the starting point for a software application. It is a "complete," working, deployable application that contains all the infrastructural and architectural elements that the software needs for its first release â€” but it has no actual functionality. It just displays "hello world" or something similar.

The purpose of a walking skeleton is to get the necessary infrastructure in place so that feature development can proceed smoothly, without distraction.
