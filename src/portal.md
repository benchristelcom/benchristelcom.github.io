#### Web / JavaScript Developer Tools

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Fast, easy-to-use dev server for single-page apps. Built-in hot-reloading and TypeScript compilation, among other features.

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) - blazing fast, but somewhat crash-prone replacement for `node` and `npm` that also implements some web APIs (but no DOM). I use Bun to run [`mdsite`](https://benchristel.github.io/mdsite) and [Taste](https://npmjs.com/package/@benchristel/taste) tests.
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) - I am experimenting with [eslint.style](https://eslint.style/) as a JavaScript/TypeScript formatter, replacing [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). See also [Anthony Fu's post "Why I don't use Prettier"](https://antfu.me/posts/why-not-prettier).
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io) - because it's still the easiest formatter to set up, and I agree with 95% of its choices.

#### Editors

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (vscode) - Pretty good out of the box, configurable, versatile, and free.
- [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/) - Expensive, but they come with pretty incredible code intelligence and refactoring tools. Lots of stuff you'd have to configure yourself or use plugins for in other editors "just works" in JetBrains.

### Tools I Have Used

- [Flow](https://flow.org/)

### Tools I Might Use Someday

- [Deno](https://deno.com/) - see also the [documentation](https://docs.deno.com/)

- [daisyUI](https://daisyui.com/)
- [SQLite](https://sqlite.org/)
- [zed](https://zed.dev/) - An editor designed for remote pair programming. Unfortunately, there's no Linux support yet, though one can [build from source](https://zed.dev/docs/development/linux) on Linux.
