- [NPM](https://npmjs.com) - Hosts NodeJS packages. Owned by Microsoft. See also the [NPM documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com).
- [Rubygems](https://rubygems.org/) - Hosts Ruby gems.

- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) - I am experimenting with [eslint.style](https://eslint.style/) as a JavaScript/TypeScript formatter, replacing [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). See also [Anthony Fu's post "Why I don't use Prettier"](https://antfu.me/posts/why-not-prettier).
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io) - because it's still the easiest formatter to set up, and I agree with 95% of its choices.
