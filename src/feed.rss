            <description><![CDATA[<p>I&apos;ve released a couple improvements to the tools I use to build this website. Those tools are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://benchristel.github.io/mdsite"><strong>mdsite</strong></a>, a simple static site generator that can turn any tree of Markdown files into HTML. If you want to write an HTML book like <a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/taoup/html/"><em>The Art of Unix Programming</em></a>, or just put your <a href>digital garden</a> on the web, <code>mdsite</code> has got your back.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/marss"><strong>marss</strong></a>, which turns a Markdown changelog or microblog into an RSS feed.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="mdsite">mdsite</h3>
<p>mdsite 0.6.0 improves on the previous release, 0.5.1, by adding support for GitHub-Flavored Markdown footnotes. You can see those in action in my <a href="https://benchristel.com/posts/alexandrian-software/alexander.html">Christopher Alexander series</a>, which I&apos;m in the middle of migrating from <a href="https://bensguide.substack.com/">Substack</a>.</p>
<h3 id="marss">marss</h3>
<p>Marss is actually getting its <em>first</em> release, so there isn&apos;t much to say about it that&apos;s not covered by <a href="https://github.com/benchristel/marss/blob/v0.0.0/README.md">the documentation</a>.</p>
<p>I wrote marss because I couldn&apos;t find a markdown-to-RSS generator that took a <em>single</em> changelog file as input. All the existing ones seem oriented toward blogs: they read a directory of posts, and generate a feed entry for each post. Contrary to what you might assume from its name, my <em>web log</em> is not a blog. It is neither a series of standalone articles, nor a stream-of-consciousness social media feed. I think of it more as a unified changelog for all of my web presences &#x2014; and crucially, one that includes only <em>notable</em> changes that I think are worth emailing people about. In order for this to work, the web log has to be decoupled from the changes to actual content (prose and software), because I update that stuff all the time in fairly insignificant ways. I&apos;m also constantly <a href="https://github.com/benchristel/benchristel.github.io/wiki">writing drafts in public</a> &#x2014; for my own convenience, because they&apos;re easier to find that way. So an RSS feed that notified people of every file I created or updated would be obnoxiously frequent.</p>
<p>Tangent time: I&apos;ve been musing about our society&apos;s tendency to order everything by recency or in-the-moment relevance, and whether this might be harming us (gee, Ben, ya think?) Some of my favorite websites (<a href="https://dreamsongs.com/">Dreamsongs</a>, <a href="https://everynoise.com/">Every Noise at Once</a>, <a href="http://ardalambion.org/">Ardalambion</a>) do not order their content chronologically. I like the timeless quality this imparts. Such websites often have changelogs &#x2014; e.g. here&apos;s  <a href="https://dreamsongs.com/SiteHistory.html">Dreamsongs&apos;</a> and <a href="http://ardalambion.org/new.htm">Ardalambion&apos;s</a>, so returning visitors can see what&apos;s new if they want. But the chronological ordering is strictly secondary.</p>
<p>Frequently-updated chronologies and feeds always feel vaguely stressful to me. That might be because we most often consult Chronos when things have gone terribly wrong. Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Programmers don&apos;t dig through the commit history when the code is self-explanatory and doing what they expect. They only do it when the number of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/1f9df7/the_only_valid_measurement_of_code_quality/">WTFs per minute</a> spikes, and they need to figure out how the code got so bad in order to understand what it even does.</li>
<li>If you see a bunch of people in a conference room poring over a timeline, you can bet they&apos;re in an incident postmortem, reconstructing the sequence of events that led up to some disaster.</li>
<li>The news is mostly bad news because people want to know what&apos;s urgent, and positive developments, though they may be recent, are not urgent. No one needs up-to-the-minute information when all is well, but we demand it in a crisis.</li>
</ul>
<p>We call on chronologies to understand present problems and trace their causes. These are important things to be able to do, but they aren&apos;t the <em>only</em> things we need to do. Forcing everything we do into a chonological stream of updates (the default on the modern web) imparts a false sense of urgency to those updates, even as it skews the information we consume toward ephemera that we&apos;ll have forgotten in a month.</p>
<p>I need to stop writing lest this become a <em>blog post</em>, but if you want to read more, here&apos;s a link to <a href="https://stackingthebricks.com/how-blogs-broke-the-web/">How Blogs Broke the Web</a> by Amy Hoy. Amy&apos;s post explains, more clearly than I can right now, a big part of what motivated me to write <a href="https://benchristel.github.io/mdsite/">mdsite</a> from scratch instead of using an off-the-shelf blogging tool. And if you&apos;re looking for something more recent and with less CSS, Mike Grindle&apos;s been writing about <a href="https://mikegrindle.com/newsletter/itm-1">the woes of timeline-based social media</a> and <a href="https://mikegrindle.com/posts/novelty">the limits of novelty and fun</a>.</p>
<p>And oh, that reminds me: The <a href="https://waywardweb.org/">Wayward Webring</a> welcomed <em>four</em> new members since my last update! You should definitely check out all their sites:</p>

            <title>August 11, 2024: Site Tidying</title>
            <guid isPermaLink="false">2024-08-11-site-tidying</guid>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>I am still working out how best to organize pages on this site. This week, the <a href="https://benchristel.com/welcome.html">welcome</a> page came into its own as the <em>de facto</em> index page for this site (The true <code>/index.html</code> being a list of links to my other web presences). Concretely, what this means is that links labeled &quot;Home&quot; go to the welcome page. The only way to navigate back to <code>/index.html</code> is to use the &quot;Out Again&quot; link at the bottom of the welcome page.</p>
<p>This is essentially an instance of the <a href="https://github.com/software-patterns/workshop/blob/master/patterns/entrance-transition.md"><strong>Entrance Transition</strong> pattern</a>, which I&apos;ve seen on a lot of personal sites &#x2014; especially older and retro-themed ones. I like it because it makes the site feel like more of a place: it has a distinct inside and a distinct outside.</p>
<hr>
<p>I&apos;m not big on the idea of &quot;standardizing&quot; websites that are ostensibly personal, but that said, I think the indieweb community has developed some good standard patterns that I&apos;d like to adopt. Specifically, I&apos;d like to have a <a href="https://uses.tech/"><code>/uses</code> page</a> that&apos;s separate from the main <a href="https://benchristel.com/portal.html">portal</a>. I think the way I&apos;ve organized my links to tools is not going to scale; a lot of them are lumped under &quot;Software Development,&quot; but some are in their own &quot;Web-based tools&quot; section. In reality, the tools in both sections run the gamut from &quot;extremely geeky&quot; (Bun, Regex 101) to &quot;something everyone should know about&quot; (uBlock Origin, Purple Air). So a reorg is probably in order.</p>
<p>Speaking of indieweb, a post in <a href="https://chat.indieweb.org/">#indieweb IRC</a> led me to <a href="https://brandons-journal.com/">Brandon&apos;s Journal</a> and his awesome <a href="https://brandons-journal.com/links/">links page</a>. That led to a conversation, which led to Brandon joining the <a href="https://waywardweb.org/">Wayward Webring</a>. Welcome, Brandon!</p>
<hr>
<p>I also discovered <a href="https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history">Maggie Appleton&apos;s deep dive on the history of digital gardening</a> and realized not only that my <a href="https://github.com/benchristel/benchristel.github.io/wiki">&quot;bliki&quot;</a> is really a digital garden, but that I independently <a href="https://github.com/benchristel/benchristel.github.io/wiki#levels-of-polish">reinvented</a> the idea of labeling &quot;epistemic status.&quot; This could be taken as evidence that <a href="https://benchristel.com/posts/0000-the-mess-we-are-in.html">civilization is forgetful and fragmented</a>, but more likely, I&apos;m just out of touch. Fine, Ward Cunningham <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/WhatIsaBliki.html">called it a bliki in 2003</a>, but the kids these days call it a digital garden. I can adapt. It is interesting though, that Appleton doesn&apos;t mention the bliki concept as a forerunner of digital gardening, so maybe there really are two distinct lineages &#x2014; or maybe the connection between them has just been lost to history.</p>
<hr>
<p>I spent a lot of time this week tinkering with various little features and quality-of-life improvements to the site. For example, the searchbar on the <a href="https://benchristel.com/portal.html">portal page</a> now has <a href="https://benchristel.com/portal/search-docs.html">documentation</a>, and I added some knobs to the CSS so that multi-column pages can be wider than single-column articles.</p>
<hr>
<p>Finally, a meta-note on how I wrote this log entry. I went into it thinking I accomplished nothing this week and had nothing to write about. Then I ran:</p>
<pre><code>git log --since 2024-08-04 --name-only
</code></pre>
<p>This lists the commits I made since the previous entry, along with the files changed by each commit. That was enough to jog my memory. Turns out I did stuff!</p>]]></description>

<p>I want a list of cross-platform <code>font-family</code> values, using only fonts that ship with operating systems.
E.g. if I want to use a humanist sans-serif typeface on my website, and I don&apos;t want my users to have
to download fonts, what are some <code>font-family</code> settings that will result in good-looking, consistent
typography across Windows, macOS, Ubuntu, iOS, and Android?</p>
<p>I feel like this is an important resource for anyone who wants to keep their website ultra-lean (as I do).
I also feel like I&apos;ve seen such a resource within the last few years, but sadly I don&apos;t have it bookmarked.
Can anyone in the audience help me out? Send email to benchristel at gmail.com. I&apos;ll give you a backlink.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<h3 id="globally-install-a-package-youre-developing">Globally install a package you&apos;re developing</h3>
<p>Today I learned that you can install a NodeJS package you&apos;re developing without first publishing it to a package registry like NPM. <code>yarn global add &quot;file:/absolute/path/to/repo&quot;</code> will do the trick.</p>

<h3 id="regosengapless-5-tiny-invariant">@regosen/gapless-5, tiny-invariant</h3>
<p>I&apos;ve listed two new JavaScript libraries I use on the <a href="https://benchristel.com/portal.html">Web Portal</a> page:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@regosen/gapless-5">@regosen/gapless-5</a> - gapless and looped audio playback on the web. Essential if you&apos;re building a music player. I&apos;m using it in my <a href="https://benchristel.github.io/meditation">meditation timer</a> to loop the audio.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/tiny-invariant">tiny-invariant</a> - a TypeScript assertion library that does <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/narrowing.html">type narrowing</a>. Handy for those cases where <em>you</em> know what type something is,
but TypeScript doesn&apos;t, and you just want to throw an error in the (presumably impossible) case where the thing is the wrong type and move on with your life. I learned about tiny-invariant by contributing to <a href="https://mafs.dev/">Mafs</a>, <a href="https://stevenpetryk.com/">Steven Petryk</a>&apos;s ReactJS library for math visualization.</li>
</ul>
