## Weeknotes, 2024-08-04

### Quotes

> â€”Ludwig Wittgenstein

### Wanted

I want a list of cross-platform `font-family` values, using only fonts that ship with operating systems.
E.g. if I want to use a humanist sans-serif typeface on my website, and I don't want my users to have
to download fonts, what are some `font-family` settings that will result in good-looking, consistent
typography across Windows, macOS, Ubuntu, iOS, and Android?

I feel like this is an important resource for anyone who wants to keep their website ultra-lean (as I do).
I also feel like I've seen such a resource within the last few years, but sadly I don't have it bookmarked.
Can anyone in the audience help me out? Send email to benchristel at gmail.com. I'll give you a backlink.

### Georgia Lacks Lining Numerals

Related to the above.

It seems like a bizarre omission, but I cannot get my web browser to display anything other than oldstyle numerals when Georgia is set as the font. I think I'm going to switch to Trebuchet MS for headings and Tahoma for body text. The
only question is, what to use as the fallback for Linux...

<h3 id="globally-install-a-package-youre-developing">Globally install a package you&#39;re developing</h3>
<p>Today I learned that you can install a NodeJS package you&#39;re developing without first publishing it to a package registry like NPM. <code>yarn global add &quot;file:/absolute/path/to/repo&quot;</code> will do the trick.</p>

<h3 id="regosengapless-5-tiny-invariant">@regosen/gapless-5, tiny-invariant</h3>
<p>I&#39;ve listed two new JavaScript libraries I use on the <a href="https://benchristel.com/portal.html">Web Portal</a> page:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@regosen/gapless-5">@regosen/gapless-5</a> - gapless and looped audio playback on the web. Essential if you&#39;re building a music player. I&#39;m using it in my <a href="https://benchristel.github.io/meditation">meditation timer</a> to loop the audio.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/tiny-invariant">tiny-invariant</a> - a TypeScript assertion library that does <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/narrowing.html">type narrowing</a>. Handy for those cases where <em>you</em> know what type something is,
but TypeScript doesn&#39;t, and you just want to throw an error in the (presumably impossible) case where the thing is the wrong type and move on with your life. I learned about tiny-invariant by contributing to <a href="https://mafs.dev/">Mafs</a>, <a href="https://stevenpetryk.com/">Steven Petryk</a>&#39;s ReactJS library for math visualization.</li>
</ul>

<p>Today being the last day of the month, I&#39;ve updated the <a href="">metrics page</a> with the latest data.</p>
