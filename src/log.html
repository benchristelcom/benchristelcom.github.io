<h3 id="wanted">Wanted</h3>
<p>I want a list of cross-platform <code>font-family</code> values, using only fonts that ship with operating systems.
E.g. if I want to use a humanist sans-serif typeface on my website, and I don&#39;t want my users to have
to download fonts, what are some <code>font-family</code> settings that will result in good-looking, consistent
typography across Windows, macOS, Ubuntu, iOS, and Android?</p>
<p>I feel like this is an important resource for anyone who wants to keep their website ultra-lean (as I do).
I also feel like I&#39;ve seen such a resource within the last few years, but sadly I don&#39;t have it bookmarked.
Can anyone in the audience help me out? Send email to benchristel at gmail.com. I&#39;ll give you a backlink.</p>

<li><a href="https://github.com/benchristel/marss">marss</a>, a Markdown-to-RSS converter. It&#39;s not quite ready for release, but I&#39;m already using it to generate the RSS feed for this page.</li>

<h3 id="globally-install-a-package-youre-developing">Globally install a package you&#39;re developing</h3>
<p>Today I learned that you can install a NodeJS package you&#39;re developing without first publishing it to a package registry like NPM. <code>yarn global add &quot;file:/absolute/path/to/repo&quot;</code> will do the trick.</p>

<h3 id="regosengapless-5-tiny-invariant">@regosen/gapless-5, tiny-invariant</h3>
<p>I&#39;ve listed two new JavaScript libraries I use on the <a href="https://benchristel.com/portal.html">Web Portal</a> page:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@regosen/gapless-5">@regosen/gapless-5</a> - gapless and looped audio playback on the web. Essential if you&#39;re building a music player. I&#39;m using it in my <a href="https://benchristel.github.io/meditation">meditation timer</a> to loop the audio.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/tiny-invariant">tiny-invariant</a> - a TypeScript assertion library that does <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/narrowing.html">type narrowing</a>. Handy for those cases where <em>you</em> know what type something is,
but TypeScript doesn&#39;t, and you just want to throw an error in the (presumably impossible) case where the thing is the wrong type and move on with your life. I learned about tiny-invariant by contributing to <a href="https://mafs.dev/">Mafs</a>, <a href="https://stevenpetryk.com/">Steven Petryk</a>&#39;s ReactJS library for math visualization.</li>
</ul>
