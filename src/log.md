### Quotes

> Philosophy is a battle against the bewitchment of our intelligence by means of language.

> â€”Ludwig Wittgenstein

### Wanted

I want a list of cross-platform `font-family` values, using only fonts that ship with operating systems.
E.g. if I want to use a humanist sans-serif typeface on my website, and I don't want my users to have
to download fonts, what are some `font-family` settings that will result in good-looking, consistent
typography across Windows, macOS, Ubuntu, iOS, and Android?

I feel like this is an important resource for anyone who wants to keep their website ultra-lean (as I do).
I also feel like I've seen such a resource within the last few years, but sadly I don't have it bookmarked.
Can anyone in the audience help me out? Send email to benchristel at gmail.com. I'll give you a backlink.

### Globally install a package you're developing

Today I learned that you can install a NodeJS package you're developing without first publishing it to a package registry like NPM. `yarn global add "file:/absolute/path/to/repo"` will do the trick.

### @regosen/gapless-5, tiny-invariant

I've listed two new JavaScript libraries I use on the [Web Portal](https://benchristel.com/portal.html) page:

- [@regosen/gapless-5](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@regosen/gapless-5) - gapless and looped audio playback on the web. Essential if you're building a music player.
- [tiny-invariant](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tiny-invariant) - a TypeScript assertion library that does [type narrowing](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/narrowing.html). Handy for those cases where _you_ know what type something is,
but TypeScript doesn't, and you just want to throw an error in the (presumably impossible) case where the thing is the wrong type and move on with your life.

### End of July

Today being the last day of the month, I've updated the [metrics page]() with the latest data.
