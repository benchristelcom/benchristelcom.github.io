### Quotes

> Philosophy is a battle against the bewitchment of our intelligence by means of language.
>
> â€”Ludwig Wittgenstein

### Wanted

I want a list of cross-platform `font-family` values, using only fonts that ship with operating systems.
E.g. if I want to use a humanist sans-serif typeface on my website, and I don't want my users to have
to download fonts, what are some `font-family` settings that will result in good-looking, consistent
typography across Windows, macOS, Ubuntu, iOS, and Android?

I feel like this is an important resource for anyone who wants to keep their website ultra-lean (as I do).
I also feel like I've seen such a resource within the last few years, but sadly I don't have it bookmarked.
Can anyone in the audience help me out? Send email to benchristel at gmail.com. I'll give you a backlink.
